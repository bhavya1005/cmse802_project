# Projectile Motion Simulation

## Project Description
This project simulates projectile motion using numerical integration, specifically Euler’s method. The goal is to apply computational modeling techniques to predict real-world motion trajectories.

## Objectives
1. Implement Euler’s method for projectile motion.
2. Visualize the trajectory using Matplotlib.
3. Analyze the effects of different initial conditions.
4. Extend the model with air resistance (optional).
5. Prepare a final presentation summarizing the results.

## Project Structure Sample
- `data/` - Stores datasets 
- `src/` - Contains Python scripts for the simulation.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for testing and development.
- `results/` - Plots and generated outputs.
- `docs/` - Documentation files and project reports.
- requirements.txt - all the python packages I might use
